# MAME ROM Organizer Configuration
# ================================
# This configuration file defines paths and settings for organizing MAME ROM sets,
# parsing metadata from local sources, and generating ES-DE compatible gamelist.xml files.

# Source Paths
# ------------
# Paths to your MAME ROM collection and metadata sources

# Path to MAME non-merged ROM set directory (contains .zip files)
source_rom_path: "/path/to/mame/roms"

# Path to MAME CHD directory (optional, contains subdirectories with .chd files)
# Set to null or comment out if you don't have CHDs
source_chd_path: "/path/to/mame/chds"

# Path to MAME XML file (e.g., mame0283.xml)
mame_xml_path: "/path/to/mame0283.xml"

# Path to MAME Multimedia directory (optional, contains /videosnaps/*.mp4)
# Set to null or comment out if you don't have videos
multimedia_path: "/path/to/mame/multimedia"

# Path to MAME Extras directory
# Expected structure:
#   - titles.zip, snap.zip, marquees.zip, flyers.zip, cabinets.zip, cpanel.zip, manuals.zip
#   - /folders/bestgames.ini
#   - /folders/genre.ini
#   - /folders/multiplayer.ini
#   - /folders/Game or No Game.ini
#   - /history/history.xml
extras_path: "/path/to/mame/extras"

# Output Paths
# ------------
# Where to place organized ROMs, media, and gamelist

# Target directory for ROM files (ES-DE ROM directory)
target_rom_path: "/path/to/ES-DE/ROMs/mame"

# Path to output gamelist.xml file
gamelist_output_path: "/path/to/ES-DE/gamelists/mame/gamelist.xml"

# Base path for media output (will create subdirectories: screenshots/, covers/, etc.)
media_output_path: "/path/to/ES-DE/media/mame"

# Filtering Options
# -----------------
# Control which games are included in the gamelist

# Path to plain text file with one MAME shortname per line (optional)
# Only games in this list will be processed
# Set to null or comment out to process all games
inclusion_list_path: null

# Minimum rating threshold (0.0 to 1.0, based on bestgames.ini)
# Only games with rating >= this value will be included (after inclusion list filter)
# Set to null or comment out to include all ratings
minimum_rating: null

# Use "Game or No Game.ini" to filter actual games from non-games
# If true, only games in the [Game] section will be included
# If false or if file doesn't exist, assumes all machines are games
use_game_or_no_game: false

# Favorite threshold (0.0 to 1.0)
# Games with rating >= this value will be marked as favorites
# Set to null or comment out to not auto-set favorites
favorite_threshold: null

# Processing Options
# ------------------
# Control how the tool operates

# Enable automatic sortname generation for games starting with articles (A, An, The)
# If true, games like "The King of Fighters" will get sortname="King of Fighters, The"
# This helps with proper alphabetical sorting in ES-DE
auto_sortname_enabled: false

# Dry run mode - validate and log what would be done without actually copying files
dry_run: false

# Merge strategy for existing gamelist.xml
# Options:
#   - "preserve_user_edits": Keep all existing fields (most conservative)
#   - "refresh_metadata": Update scraped fields, preserve user edits (recommended)
#   - "reset_all": Complete reset (nuclear option)
merge_strategy: "refresh_metadata"

# Validate gamelist integrity after generation
validate_output: true

# Example Configurations
# ----------------------
# 
# Example 1: Process high-quality arcade games only
# inclusion_list_path: null
# minimum_rating: 0.7
# use_game_or_no_game: true
# favorite_threshold: 0.9
#
# Example 2: Process specific game list from file
# inclusion_list_path: "/path/to/my_games.txt"
# minimum_rating: null
# use_game_or_no_game: false
# favorite_threshold: null
#
# Example 3: Process all games
# inclusion_list_path: null
# minimum_rating: null
# use_game_or_no_game: true
# favorite_threshold: null
